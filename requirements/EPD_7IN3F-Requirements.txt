This is a notepad for the EPD_7IN3F Requirements.

0 Overview

1 Terminology
The program code related to the functionality of the EPD (shorthand for E Paper Display) shall be grouped up in a Module. The term term EPD-Module shall be used in further reference to this part of the program.

2 Scope
The EPD-Module shall be able to safely communicate with the EDP 7IN3F (7.3 inches version f).

3 Interfaces

REQ 3.1
The EPD-Module shall provide an interface that takes as input/parameters a pointer to image data to display, a xstart and ystart determining the start of the image on the EPD, image_width and image_heigh to determine the size of the image to be displayed; outputs/returns a status of success of failed process of sending the data to the EPD.

REQ 3.2
The EPD-Module shall provide an interface that takes as input/parameters a color to be displayed on the display; outputs/returns a status of success of failed process of sending the data to the EPD.

REQ 3.3
The EPD-Module shall provide an interface that takes no input/parameter; outputs/returns a status of success of failed process of sending the data to the EPD.
The data to be transfered to the EPD shall reset the EPD.

REQ 3.4
The EPD-Module shall provide an interface that takes no input/parameter; outputs/returns a status of success of failed process of sending the data to the EPD.
The data transfered to the EPD shall put the EPD to deep sleep.

REQ 3.5
The EPD-Mopdule shall provide an interface that takes as inputs/parameters the RST_PIN (Reset), DC_PIN (Data / Command), BUSY_PIN; outputs/returns a status of success of failed process of sending the data to the EPD.
